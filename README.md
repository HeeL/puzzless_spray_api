# API for the Puzzless project

This application provides an API for the [Puzzless](http://puzzless.com) project. It has been built with Scala and [Spray](http://www.spray.io).
The main purpose of this API is to provide all the information from Puzzless website to an Android app written on [Scaloid](https://github.com/pocorall/scaloid/).
As for now the API represents the resources:
* riddles
* categories of riddles (logic, math...)
* user comments to riddles.
